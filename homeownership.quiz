  The median down payment has decreased significantly since the housing boom. It was 20 percent in 2006 but was just 5 percent for purchase mortgages in 2017. In April 2018, the median loan-to-value (LTV) ratio stood at 92 percent. We use LTV ratios to understand down payments. The LTV ratio represents the ratio between the amount of the mortgage and the cost of the houseâ€”so an LTV ratio of 95 percent means that the loan covers 95 percent of the value of the house, and the remaining 5 percent is what the borrower put down as a down payment. There are, however, significant variations by state.<img class = "alert-img" src = "img/answer1-01.png"/>

  While most GSE mortgages have larger down payments, low-down payment programs offered by <a target="_blank" href="http://myhome.freddiemac.com/buy/down-payment-options.html">Freddie Mac</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fanniemae.com/content/fact_sheet/97-ltv-options.pdf">Fannie Mae</a>, which require as little as 3 percent down, have been growing in recent years. In 2014, only 1.2 percent of purchase mortgage loans were originated with a loan-to-value ratio of 95 percent or higher; that share has increased nearly tenfold and stood at 11.1 percent in the first half of 2018. Most FHA mortgages have a 3.5 percent down payment or less.<img class = "alert-img" src = "img/answer5-01.png"/>
